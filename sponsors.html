    *You can always start out with a single tournament sponsorship and add tournaments as the season progresses.
    Your logo size on the jersey will be bumped up with each tournament as will your social media shout-outs.
    Your sponsorship tier on our website will also constantly be updated*
    <br><br>
    Sponsorships can come in many forms. Anything from products/services donated to a monetary contribution. A
    monetary contribution can also bump up your sponsorship tier.
    <br><br>
    Any contribution of $500 or more automatically qualifies for the PLATINUM tier
    $400-$499 automatically qualifies for GOLD tier
    $250-$399 automatically qualifies for SILVER tier
    <br><br>
    We are always open to any other ideas as well, just let us know what you have in mind!
    <br><br>
    Thank you very much for taking the time to hear about what we are doing this season!
