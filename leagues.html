                <br>
                Start time: 6pm
                <br>
                Registration fee: $60 PER TEAM
                <br>
                Divisions will be based on number of teams.
                <br>
                Each series will be a best of 5.
                <br>
                Each win in a series is worth 1 point
                A series sweep gives you 1 additional point
                Max points available in a series, 4
                <br>
                The 8th/9th week will be a tournament
                <br><br>
                Teams will be seeded based off of results from the previous weeks
                Seeding will go by: Overall points, head-to-head and then scoring point differential
                Playoff brackets are best of 3 to 21
                <br>
                If sunlight becomes an issue towards the end of the bracket, play will be suspended and continue the following Tuesday. You may not suspend play in the middle of a series, the game must be called prior to the series start.
                <br>
                Teams may have a roster of NO MORE than 4 players. This will be strictly enforced.
                All rosters must be finalized by 11:59 on 4/15/18
                Substitutions ARE allowed mid series but once a player is substituted they may not come back in the series. No more than 3 roster spots will be active during a given series.
                <br>
                <br>
                If a team can ABSOLUTELY not make it on a Tuesday, they will have until the following Monday to play a make up series. The team who could not make the match has to make up the match when it is convenient for the other team. If the game does not get made up by Monday night. The team that rescheduled would receive 0 points and the other team would receive 3 points. (no additional points for the series sweep)
                <br><br>
                ****THERE WILL ONLY BE 2 MAKE UP GAMES PERMITTED!!!!!!!****
                <br><br>
                **Please note that most of the players in the league specifically set aside Tuesdays to play, make-up games are only to be scheduled due to extreme circumstances!
                <br>
                If both teams agree, you can meet a bit earlier to start their series.
                <br>
                All scores from each match must be recorded and given to me, Tommy, on sheets provided.  If you play a series on a “makeup day”, the results must be emailed or text to me by Monday night.
                <br>
                Cleats are allowed. If you want to play barefoot, play at your own risk!
                <br><br>
                ALL TEAMS MUST HAVE MATCHING TOPS! It can be a plain tank or t shirt or be as cool as you’d like to make it. I’d like to see teams looking as coordinated as possible.
                <br><br>
                The RMRL will run during Tuesday Night Roundnet, feel free to get to the park before 6 to warm up with everyone who came for TRN pick-up, feel free to stay and play after your best of 5 series is done!
                <br><br>
