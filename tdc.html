<h4 style="color: #fced5e; margin: auto; max-width: 600px">
    The Tour De Colorado is a series of tournaments through out Colorado, aimed to crown the top 8 players in the state.
    While tournaments are open to any team, only teams from Colorado can earn points.
    <br><br>
    This year, we are focusing on individual rankings.
    Each teammate will split the points earned from a tournament placement. For every tournament you play with a new teammate, five points will be added to your individual score.
    <br><br>
    Last year's top four teams each won trophies and a fully sublimated, custom Rocky Mountain Roundnet Elite jersey.
    These jerseys were provided by our title sponsor: Savage Apparel.
    Prizes for 2018 have yet to be determined, but will be awesome.
